    <h1>Hi Ania!</h1>
    <p>It's been 2 months since I confessed, and ang loyal ko noh? Anyway, I want to say thank you for being one of my closest friends, the one who listens,
         the one who comforts, and the one who cherishes me, the one who sees my worth. I am very thankful that you came into my life, I have no words for what you have done to me,
          and I wish I could do more for you in the future. Being your listening ear and your therapist is a great honor for me, and I hope it will stay that way. Thank you, and always
           remember that there is someone here who loves you, and cares for you. And if you really need someone to rant to the most, I would shelter you from the world and let you talk, 
           and I would listen.
        .</p>
    <p>-M </p>
